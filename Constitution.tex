\section{Framework of Government}
\subsection{Deliberative Assembly}
\subsubsection{Formation}
\paragraph{Members}
The deliberative assembly shall consist of ninety-three local representatives and thirty-one party representatives.
\paragraph{Elections}
Local representatives shall be elected every fourth year in their respective districts. They shall be divided into classes such that one-fourth is elected every second year.

Party representatives shall be elected every second year in a general election. Each political party or caucus shall be awarded a number of seats proportionate to their respective shares of the total vote.
\paragraph{Qualifications}
Each member of the deliberative assembly shall have been a citizen of the state for two years prior to the date of their elections. No person shall be elected without having attained eighteen years of age.
\paragraph{Majority and Quorum}
Except as otherwise provided by law, a two-thirds affirmative majority shall be necessary for the deliberative assembly to decide any question. A quorum shall consist of a requisite number of members for that majority, including each party representative or alternate thereof. Absent members may be compelled to attend by penalties established by the rules of the deliberative assembly.
\paragraph{State Governor}
The state governor shall preside over the regular sessions of the deliberative assembly and see to its day-to-day business. The state governor shall be chosen by the local representatives in a secret election.
\subsubsection{State Executive}
\paragraph{Appointment}
The state executive shall be nominated by the state governor and confirmed by the deliberative assembly.
\paragraph{Vacancy and Succession}
Upon the vacancy of the office or at other times during which the state executive is unable to perform the duties of office, the longest-serving member of the deliberative assembly shall assume the duties of office and undertake its powers until a successor is nominated and confirmed or the incumbent state executive regains the ability to execute the powers of office. During this time, the replacement state executive shall not exercise any powers or duties within the deliberative assembly.
\paragraph{Relations with State Councils}
The state executive shall serve as an \textit{ex officio} member of each state council. In this capacity, the state executive shall exercise no vote unless the members stand equally divided. The state executive shall convene and adjourn state councils as provided by law.
\paragraph{Powers}
The state executive may call forth the militia to execute the laws of the state, to suppress insurrection, and to act in the event of a natural disaster within the state. The state executive may grant pardons and reprieves for the crimes of the state with the advice and consent of the judicial council. The state executive may convene, preside over, and adjourn special sessions of the deliberative assembly and of the state councils. The state executive shall enforce the laws of the state as the state executive councils provide.
\subsubsection{Legislative Process}
\paragraph{Legislative Committees}
For each pair of legislative and executive councils, there shall be a corresponding committee of the deliberative assembly.

The members of each committee shall be drawn from the local representatives and assigned by the state governor. Each caucus of the deliberative assembly shall be assigned an equal number of seats on each committee. 

Upon receiving a bill from its corresponding legislative council, each committee shall discuss and debate the bill. Amendments to the bill may be proposed and adopted by the committee during this time if approved by the supervisory judge of the corresponding legislative committee as complying with the purpose of the bill; decisions of the supervisory judge may be appealed to the court of appeals created for this purpose. The bill shall pass from the committee after ten days of receiving it unless the committee agrees to postpone, but cannot be postponed more than thirty days. The legislative process of the bill is terminated if the committee unanimously rejects the bill.
\paragraph{Considering of Bills}
Upon the passage of a bill from committee, the state governor shall schedule the bill for open discussion and debate for a time not less than seventy-two hours and in no less than three separate meetings of the deliberative assembly. Once the allotted discussion time has expired, the bill shall lay dormant for two days during which time representatives shall publicly issue any concerns and stand-asides or blocks along with the reasons therefor. After those two days, the state governor shall schedule a vote. If the deliberative assembly fails to approve the bill, it shall then vote to reject the bill. If both votes fail, a snap election shall be organized.
\paragraph{Stand-asides and Blocks}
Stand-asides shall not be considered in vote tallying, quorum, or majority requirements when voting on a bill. A block causes the immediate return of a bill to its originating committee for further amendment and later re-introduction, but if blocked again, the legislative process of that bill shall terminate. A block must be sustained by more than one-third of the local representatives and may be issued only by a party representative. Each party representative shall be entitled to one non-transferable and non-renewable block per each term, but may use that block twice on the same bill.
\subsubsection{Specific Powers}
\paragraph{Subpoenas}
The deliberative assembly or any committee may compel public officers, except judges, to provide sworn testimony.
\paragraph{Question Time}
The state governor shall hold question time once a week unless it is agreed to forego the event, during which the state governor and other officers of the deliberative assembly shall answer any questions of the members of the assembly.
\paragraph{Votes of No Confidence}
The deliberative assembly may dismiss the state governor upon a successful vote of no confidence. A motion of no confidence shall be brought only by a public petition bearing the signatures of one-tenth of the members of the deliberative assembly. Votes of no confidence shall not be scheduled within six months before an election of the deliberative assembly or less than four months after a previous unsuccessful vote of no confidence.
\paragraph{Impeachment}
The deliberative assembly may impeach any public officer of the state, including members of the assembly and juridical nominees as juridical nominees. Upon the adoption of an article of impeachment giving reasonable notice to the acts or omissions alleged to constitute impeachable offenses, a special state council shall be convened consisting of seven juridical nominees selected by lot. This council shall try the case against the impeached officer. The deliberative assembly shall elect two members to act as their representatives. The trial shall be conducted in the manner of civil proceedings and the impeached officer shall not be permitted to invoke protections against self-incrimination except as applicable in a general civil case. Conviction shall require the unanimous concurrence of the members of the council. Judgment shall not extend beyond removal from office and disqualification to hold any office of honor, trust, or profit of the state. The impeached officer, whether convicted or acquitted, shall be liable to prosecution and punishment pursuant to the law. The impeached officer shall not exercise the powers of office upon impeachment until acquittal.
\subsubsection{Snap Elections}
Snap elections of the deliberative assembly shall be held if a budget is not approved no less than two weeks prior to the expiration of the current budget, if the deliberative assembly is unable to elect a state governor or state executive for a period of time exceeding thirty days, or as otherwise provided by law.

During times when the deliberative assembly is disbanded, the state councils may execute necessary and proper laws subject to final veto by the state executive. The deliberative assembly may reverse such laws when it reconvenes.
